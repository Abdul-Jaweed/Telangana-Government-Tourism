**The Telangana Government Tourism Department** is responsible for promoting and developing tourism in the Indian state of Telangana. Its main objectives are to attract tourists to Telangana, create tourism infrastructure, and develop new tourism products. The department offers a variety of tourism services and facilities such as accommodation, transportation, and tour packages. It also organizes various events and festivals throughout the year to showcase the state's culture and heritage.

**Telangana** is one of India’s leading states and has published its tourism data under its open data policy.

As a data analyst, Peter Pandey saw this as an opportunity to expand his skills and show his work on a bigger scale. Peter Pandey’s idea is to find the patterns in the given data, do additional research, and give data-informed recommendations to the Telangana government which can be used to increase their revenue by improving administrative operations.


Peter began his work by framing some primary, and secondary research questions and recommendation ideas.
